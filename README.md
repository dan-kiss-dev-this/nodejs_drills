After completing 98 Lessons including coding exercises on Node.js I'm pleased to have completed Anthony Alicea's Learn and Understand NodeJS Udemy course. Topics included making and using apis, streams, routing, backend web development best practices.

Various coding excercises in Node.js are here. My output is in the folders titled Starter, the Finished folder is what the instructor's output looks like. To run the code navigate into the directory of the file you wish to run and type $ node app.js

For example: 
$ cd home/nodejs_learning/F11_Pipes/Starter
$ node app.js
